export const HEADER_PROMPT = `Generate an infographic header with a whimsical and illustrative style for a blog named "MILE HIGH AI LABS". The overall mood should be engaging, curious, and intellectually playful. Use a clean, hand-drawn vector art style with a mix of warm (orange/yellow) and cool (blue/grey) colors on a white background.

Main Text Element:
- Primary Title: "MILE HIGH AI LABS"
- Font Style: Hand-drawn, bold, rounded sans-serif with a "bouncy" baseline, as if drawn with a thick marker.
- Color: Warm orange.
- Position: Prominently in the center-left.

- Secondary Tagline: "Cutting Edge Research and Labs"
- Font Style: Smaller, thinner, hand-drawn sans-serif.
- Color: Muted light blue or grey.
- Position: Centered directly below the primary title.

Illustrative Elements:
- Parachuting Stick Figure (Top Left): A simple stick figure descending with a parachute that has subtle circuit board patterns. Positioned top-left, near the "MILE" text.
- Stick Figures Interacting with Text:
    - One figure climbing the "M" in "MILE" with a tiny wrench.
    - Another using the "H" in "HIGH" as a seesaw with a small cog.
    - A figure climbing the "A" in "AI" with a "0101" thought bubble.
    - Another standing by the "L" in "LABS", pointing to a tiny glowing "AI" symbol.
- Large Abstract AI Brain (Right Side):
    - A stylized, translucent, glowing neural network occupying the right third of the image. It should be an interconnected web of blue, purple, and green nodes and lines.
    - Include glowing pathways and faint background patterns suggesting data flow.
- Stick Figures Interacting with AI Brain:
    - One figure on a large node, tinkering with a wire.
    - Another figure "plugging into" a glowing port on the AI brain.
    - Two figures tumbling downwards from the brain with "ERROR" text above them.
    - One figure observing the data flow with a magnifying glass.

Composition & Layout:
- Background: Pure white.
- Balance: The heavy text on the left balances the detailed AI brain on the right.
- Scale: The stick figures should be tiny compared to the text and AI brain, emphasizing the scale of AI exploration.
